						p They are the foundation of the self. Without them life has no storyline, greater purpose, or meaning. There are many ways to pass down memories--writing, photographs, home videos, word of mouth--but each of these methods has the tendency to degrade over time and leave out important details. They represent but a small and sometimes dubious fraction of our life experience.
						p Past Perfect offers the solution to these problems. We provide a secure mirror backup of your memories, so friends, loved ones and, if you wish, historians will be able to access them into eternity.
